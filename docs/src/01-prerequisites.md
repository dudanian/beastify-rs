# Prerequisites

This guide will assume you have access the following installed:

* a working Rust install with `wasm` target
* `wasm-pack`
* `npm`

In addition, we will be using the following when building:

* `web-ext`
* `webpack`

Also this tutorial exclusively uses Firefox, although it could probably be adapted to work with Chrome.
