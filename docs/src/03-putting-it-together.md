# Putting it all together

We went over most of the basic concepts to rewrite `choose_beast.js` in Rust. I'm not going to go over everything here, but you can feel free to check out [my code on Github](https://github.com/dudanian/beastify-rs) to see how the final version looks. Or feel free to tackle the rest of the rewrite yourself!
